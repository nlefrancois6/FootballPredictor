# FootballPredictor
Predict offensive football plays using sklearn classification algorithms and PySimpleGUI interface.

DCPredNextPlay.py runs the GUI to make predictions in real-time. Training data from 2019 RSEQ season is included, but the app is also capable of taking in new data and building a dataset from scratch for use in a league where adequate historical data or game film is not available.
